I have finally gotten some sort of site up and running. It took a while to get some of the details worked out, but I think it's just about there.

I'm still not totally happy with the style, and I'm definitely short of content, but that will just take some time. The style isn't quite right yet, but it's a work in progress. Also I will eventually be adding a page listing projects I'm currently working on, so stay tuned for that.

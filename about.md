# About Me

My name is Dave Korhumel, and I am currently a third year computer science student at Rochester Institute of Technology. There are many things I enjoy doing in my free time. I enjoy working on side projects, many of which are available on [Github](https://github.com/dpk2442?tab=repositories). I also have a server, which I primarily run for my friends and I to use for various things, such as voice chat.

My last co-op was with [Oracle Primavera](https://www.oracle.com/applications/primavera/index.html), a global business unit of Oracle. While there I worked on [Prime](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/primavera/primavera-prime-capital-plan-management/overview/index.html), a project management web application.
